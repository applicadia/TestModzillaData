{"Title":"Newly-diagnosed Metastatic Breast-Cancer","Description":"51 year old female with newly-diagnosed metastatic breast cancer.  \n\nAt the age of 49, she was diagnosed with stage 3A triple-negative breast cancer after feeling a lump in her right armpit.\n \nHer primary care physician ordered a right breast diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound that showed a 3.0 cm mass in the right breast upper outer quadrant, as well as matted level I right axillary lymph nodes. Given the suspicious lymph nodes a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was ordered to assess for the presence of distant metastatses. This scan did not show distant metastases. Core needle biopsies of both the right breast mass and the right axillary lymph nodes showed infiltrating ductal carcinoma that was Estrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor and HER2 negative (0 by IHC). She was clinically staged (AJCC7) as a cT2 cN2a M0 stage 3A breast cancer.\n \nOf note, her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 50, and Elise was found to be BRCA-2 positive at the time of her initial diagnosis.\n \nShe underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with dose-dense adriamycin - cytoxan and paclitaxel, followed by bilateral mastectomies and right axillary lymph node dissection on 3/30/2016. Residual disease was noted in one of nine axillary lymph nodes, and her post-neoadjuvant stage was ypT0 ypN1a M0, she was downstaged to pathologic stage 2A.\n \nShe was well until she developed back pain in early January, 2018. The pain worsened over several weeks, and her primary care physician ordered an xray of her lumbar spine. This showed a lesion suspicious for metastatic disease in her L2 vertebral body. Her primary care physician alerted her medical oncologist, and a PET CT was obtained. Unfortunately this showed diffuse skeletal metastases involving multiple vertebrae and ribs and several FDG-avid liver lesions.\n \nPercutaneous CT-guided biopsy of the largest liver lesion demonstrated infiltrating ductal carcinoma consistent with a breast primary. The tumor is negative for ER, PR and HER2. Based on the biopsy-proven distant liver metastasis her current disease status is metastatic breast cancer, initial clinical stage 3A, post-neoadjuvant stage 2A.\n","Order":0.0}
