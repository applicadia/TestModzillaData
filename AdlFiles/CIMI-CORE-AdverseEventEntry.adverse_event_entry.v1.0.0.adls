Note the difference between seriousness and criticality:  giving the wrong substance to a patient might not have had a serious impact to their health (e.g., administered Vitamin D by error) but the act of giving a wrong substance to a patient could be life threatening if the patient were allergic&#47;intolerant to that substance. 

Another example: Patient is given a medication that adversely impacts their heart rhythm. This poses a life-threatening risk to the patient even if the actual instance was of moderate seriousness.">
