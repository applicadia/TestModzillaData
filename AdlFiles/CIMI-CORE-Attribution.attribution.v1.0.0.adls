                description = <"Attribution provides a formal pattern and reusable structure for attributes of a record that describes an activity in a process involved in producing, delivering or otherwise influencing the entry in a record. Attribution provides a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions are a form of contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own provenance. Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document Completion - has the artifact been legally authenticated), all of which may impact security, privacy, and trust policies.

Attribution provides a common reference model pattern that may be included directly within a clinical statement (e.g., the metadata associated with the recording of a clinical statement in a system) or within the Provenance pattern when it is preferrable to have such information external to but referencing the clinical statement (see Provenance). Note that, when included directly within a clinical statement, updates made to attribution attribute values will result in a versioning change in the instance. When part of the Provenance class, updates to provenance do not result in an update of the clinical statement referenced by the Provenance class (see Provenance.target).">
