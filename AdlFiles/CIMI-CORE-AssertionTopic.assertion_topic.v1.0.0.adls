                description = <"An assertion is a finding that takes the form of a single coded concept, without an explicit measureable property. An assertion is used to express findings such as 'patient has diabetes' or 'patient has high blood pressure'. An assertion is not expressed as a {measureable property, measured value} pair; if the finding takes that form, EvaluationResult should be used. Note that EvaluationResults {eye color, blue} can sometimes be expressed as assertions and vice versa (blue eye color).">
